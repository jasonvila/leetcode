b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nGiven a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn\'t exist, output -1 for this number.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,2,1]\r\n<b>Output:</b> [2,-1,2]\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> The first 1\'s next greater number is 2; </pre></p></p></div>'
