b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Given an m * n matrix <b>M</b> initialized with all <b>0</b>\'s and several update operations.</p>\n<p>Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two <b>positive</b> integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, which means <b>M[i][j]</b> should be <b>added by one</b> for all <b>0 &lt;= i &lt; a</b> and <b>0 &lt;= j &lt; b</b>. </p>\n<p>You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> \r\nm = 3, n = 3\r\noperations = [[2,2],[3,3]]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 4\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> \r\nInitially, M = \r\n[[0, 0, 0],\r\n [0, 0, 0],\r\n [0, 0, 0]]\r\n\r\nAfter performing [2,2], M = \r\n[[1, 1, 0],\r\n [1, 1, 0],\r\n [0, 0, 0]]\r\n\r\nAfter performing [3,3], M = \r\n[[2, 2, 1],\r\n [2, 2, 1],\r\n [1, 1, 1]]\r\n\r\nSo the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M.
