b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nAssume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor g<sub>i</sub>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s<sub>j</sub>. If s<sub>j</sub> &gt;= g<sub>i</sub>, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\r\nYou may assume the greed factor is always positive. <br/>\r\nYou cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3], [1,1]\r\n\r\n<b>Output:</b> 1\r\n\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \r\nAnd even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\r\nYou need to output 1.\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,2], [1,2,3]\r\n\r\n<b>Output:</b> 2\r\n\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. \r\nYou have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, \r\nYou need to output 2.\r\n</pre>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
