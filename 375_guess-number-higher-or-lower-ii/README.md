b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:<p>\n<p>I pick a number from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>n</strong>. You have to guess which number I picked.</p>\n<p>Every time you guess wrong, I\'ll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower. </p>\n<p>However, when you guess a particular number x,  and you guess wrong, you pay <b>$x</b>. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Example:</b>\n<pre>\r\nn = 10, I pick 8.\r\n\r\nFirst round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it\'s higher. You pay $5.\r\nSecond round: You guess 7, I tell you that it\'s higher. You pay $7.\r\nThird round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it\'s lower. You pay $9.\r\n\r\nGame over. 8 is the number I picked.\r\n\r\nYou end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p>Given a particular <strong>n \xe2\x89\xa5 1</strong>, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a <b>win</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/agave/">@agave</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/">@StefanPochmann</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></p>\n</p></p></div>'
