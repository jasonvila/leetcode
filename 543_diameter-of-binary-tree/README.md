b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nGiven a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <b>longest</b> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Example:</b><br/>\r\nGiven a binary tree <br/>\n<pre>\r\n          1\r\n         / \\\r\n        2   3\r\n       / \\     \r\n      4   5    \r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nReturn <b>3</b>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b>\r\nThe length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\r\n</p></p>\n</div>'
