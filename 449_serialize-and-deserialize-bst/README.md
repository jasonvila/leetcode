b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. </p>\n<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a <b>binary search tree</b>. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The encoded string should be as compact as possible.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.\r\n</p></p>\n</div>'
