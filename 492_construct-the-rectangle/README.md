b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nFor a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page\'s size. So, given a specific rectangular web page\xe2\x80\x99s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:<pre>\r\n1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\r\n<br/>2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L &gt;= W.\r\n<br/>3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\r\n</pre>\r\nYou need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b><br>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> 4\r\n<b>Output:</b> [2, 2]\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \r\nBut according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.\r\n</pre>\n</br></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\n<ol>\n<li>The given area won\'t exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer</li>\n<li>The web page\'s width and length you designed must be positive integers.</li>\n</ol>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
