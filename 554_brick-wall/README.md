b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the <b>top</b> to the <b>bottom</b> and cross the <b>least</b> bricks. </p>\n<p>\r\nThe brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right. \r\n</p>\n<p>If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks. </p>\n<p><b>You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. </b></p>\n<p><b>Example:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> \r\n[[1,2,2,1],\r\n [3,1,2],\r\n [1,3,2],\r\n [2,4],\r\n [3,1,2],\r\n [1,3,1,1]]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 2\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> \r\n<img src="https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/brick_wall.png" width="30%">\r\n</img></pre>\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\n<ol>\n<li>The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won\'t exceed INT_MAX.</li>\n<li>The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won\'t exceed 20,000. </li>\n</ol>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
