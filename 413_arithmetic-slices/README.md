b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.</p>\n<p>For example, these are arithmetic sequence:</p>\n<pre>1, 3, 5, 7, 9\r\n7, 7, 7, 7\r\n3, -1, -5, -9</pre>\n<p>The following sequence is not arithmetic.</p> <pre>1, 1, 2, 5, 7</pre>\n<br/>\n<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 &lt;= P &lt; Q &lt; N.</p>\n<p>A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:<br/>\r\n    A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 &lt; Q.</p>\n<p>The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A. </p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>Example:</b>\n<pre>\r\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nreturn: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.\r\n</pre></p>\n</p></div>'
