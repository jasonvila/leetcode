b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. </p>\n<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>\n<p>\r\nFor example, you may serialize the following tree\r\n<pre>\r\n    1\r\n   / \\\r\n  2   3\r\n     / \\\r\n    4   5\r\n</pre>\r\nas <code>"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"</code>, just the same as <a href="https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree">how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree</a>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/Louis1992">@Louis1992</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></p>\n</div>'
