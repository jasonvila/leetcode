b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers <code>(h, k)</code>, where <code>h</code> is the height of the person and <code>k</code> is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h</code>. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\r\nThe number of people is less than 1,100.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example</b>\n<pre>\r\nInput:\r\n[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]\r\n</pre>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
