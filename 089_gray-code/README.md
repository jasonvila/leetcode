b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.</p>\n<p>Given a non-negative integer <i>n</i> representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.</p>\n<p>For example, given <i>n</i> = 2, return <code>[0,1,3,2]</code>. Its gray code sequence is:</p>\n<pre>\r\n00 - 0\r\n01 - 1\r\n11 - 3\r\n10 - 2\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\r\nFor a given <i>n</i>, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.\r\n</p>\n<p>For example, <code>[0,2,3,1]</code> is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.</p>\n<p>For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.</p></p>\n</div>'
