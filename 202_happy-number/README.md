b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".</p>\n<p>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</p>\n<p><b>Example:\xc2\xa0</b>19 is a happy number</p>\n<ul style="list-style: none;">\n<li>1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82</li>\n<li>8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68</li>\n<li>6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100</li>\n<li>1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/mithmatt">@mithmatt</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts">@ts</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></p>\n</div>'
