b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nGiven an array of words and a length <i>L</i>, format the text such that each line has exactly <i>L</i> characters and is fully (left and right) justified.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces <code>\' \'</code> when necessary so that each line has exactly <i>L</i> characters.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nExtra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFor the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFor example,<br/>\n<b>words</b>: <code>["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]</code><br/>\n<b>L</b>: <code>16</code>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nReturn the formatted lines as:<br/>\n<pre>\r\n[\r\n   "This    is    an",\r\n   "example  of text",\r\n   "justification.  "\r\n]\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> Each word is guaranteed not to exceed <i>L</i> in length.\r\n</p>\n<p class="showspoilers"><a href="#" onclick="showSpoilers(this); return false;">click to show corner cases.</a></p>\n<div class="spoilers"><b>Corner Cases:</b>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>A line other than the last line might contain only one word.
