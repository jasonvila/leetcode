b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins. </p>\n<p>What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers? </p>\n<p>For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total &gt;= 100.</p>\n<p>Given an integer <code>maxChoosableInteger</code> and another integer <code>desiredTotal</code>, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally. </p>\n<p>You can always assume that <code>maxChoosableInteger</code> will not be larger than 20 and <code>desiredTotal</code> will not be larger than 300.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example</b>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b>\r\nmaxChoosableInteger = 10\r\ndesiredTotal = 11\r\n\r\n<b>Output:</b>\r\nfalse\r\n\r\n<b>Explanation:</b>\r\nNo matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.\r\nThe first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.\r\nIf the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.\r\nThe second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is &gt;= desiredTotal.\r\nSame with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.\r\n</pre>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
