b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.</p>\n<p>You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.<p>\n<p>\n<b>Example:</b><br/>\r\nGiven <code>1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;NULL</code>,<br/>\r\nreturn <code>1-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;NULL</code>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b><br/>\r\nThe relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input. <br/>\r\nThe first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/DjangoUnchained">@DjangoUnchained</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></p>\n</p></p></div>'
