b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Given an Iterator class interface with methods: <code>next()</code> and <code>hasNext()</code>, design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the <code>peek()</code> operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>.</p>\n<p>Call <code>next()</code> gets you 1, the first element in the list.</p>\n<p>Now you call <code>peek()</code> and it returns 2, the next element. Calling <code>next()</code> after that <i><b>still</b></i> return 2.</p>\n<p>You call <code>next()</code> the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling <code>hasNext()</code> after that should return false.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Follow up</b>: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?</p>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/porker2008">@porker2008</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></hr></p>\n</div>'
