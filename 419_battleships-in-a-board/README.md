b'<div class="question-description">\n<p>Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with <code>\'X\'</code>s, empty slots are represented with <code>\'.\'</code>s. You may assume the following rules:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.</li>\n<li>Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape <code>1xN</code> (1 row, N columns) or <code>Nx1</code> (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.</li>\n<li>At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Example:</b><br/>\n<pre>X..X\r\n...X\r\n...X\r\n</pre>\r\nIn the above board there are 2 battleships.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Invalid Example:</b><br/>\n<pre>...X\r\nXXXX\r\n...X\r\n</pre>\r\nThis is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.\r\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Follow up:</b><br/>Could you do it in <b>one-pass</b>, using only <b>O(1) extra memory</b> and <b>without modifying</b> the value of the board?</p></p>\n</p></p></div>'
