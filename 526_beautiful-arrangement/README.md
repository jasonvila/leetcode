b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nSuppose you have <b>N</b> integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these <b>N</b> numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the i<sub>th</sub> position (1 ? i ? N) in this array:\r\n<ol>\n<li>The number at the i<sub>th</sub> position is divisible by <b>i</b>.</li>\n<li><b>i</b> is divisible by the number at the i<sub>th</sub> position.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nNow given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> 2\r\n<b>Output:</b> 2\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> \r\n<br/>The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:\r\n<br/>Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).\r\n<br/>Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).\r\n<br/>The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:\r\n<br/>Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).\r\n<br/>Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\n<ol>\n<li><b>N</b> is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.</li>\n</ol>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
