b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>A sequence of numbers is called a <strong>wiggle sequence</strong> if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence. </p>\n<p>For example, <code>[1,7,4,9,2,5]</code> is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, <code>[1,4,7,2,5]</code> and <code>[1,7,4,5,5]</code> are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.</p>\n<p>Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.</p>\n<p><b>Examples:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,7,4,9,2,5]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 6\r\nThe entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.\r\n\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 7\r\nThere are several subsequences that achieve this length.
