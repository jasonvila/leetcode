b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nThere are <b>N</b> students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a <b>direct</b> friend of B, and B is a <b>direct</b> friend of C, then A is an <b>indirect</b> friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nGiven a <b>N*N</b> matrix <b>M</b> representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the i<sub>th</sub> and j<sub>th</sub> students are <b>direct</b> friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> \r\n[[1,1,0],\r\n [1,1,0],\r\n [0,0,1]]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 2\r\n<b>Explanation:</b>The 0<sub>th</sub> and 1<sub>st</sub> students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. <br/>The 2<sub>nd</sub> student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> \r\n[[1,1,0],\r\n [1,1,1],\r\n [0,1,1]]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 1\r\n<b>Explanation:</b>The 0<sub>th</sub> and 1<sub>st</sub> students are direct friends, the 1<sub>st</sub> and 2<sub>nd</sub> students are direct friends, <br/>so the 0<sub>th</sub> and 2<sub>nd</sub> students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.\r\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\n<ol>\n<li>N is in range [1,200].</li>\n<li>M[i][i] = 1 for all students.</li>\n<li>If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.</li>\n</ol>\n</p></p>\n</div>'
