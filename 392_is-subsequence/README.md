b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>\r\nGiven a string <b>s</b> and a string <b>t</b>, check if <b>s</b> is subsequence of <b>t</b>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both <b>s</b> and <b>t</b>. <b>t</b> is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and <b>s</b> is a short string (&lt;=100).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nA subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br/>\n<b>s</b> = <code>"abc"</code>, <b>t</b> = <code>"ahbgdc"</code>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nReturn <code>true</code>.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br/>\n<b>s</b> = <code>"axc"</code>, <b>t</b> = <code>"ahbgdc"</code>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nReturn <code>false</code>.\r\n</p>\n<p><b>Follow up:</b><br/>\r\nIf there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k &gt;= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?</p>\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br/>Special thanks to <a href="https://leetcode.com/pbrother/">@pbrother</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p></p>\n</div>'
