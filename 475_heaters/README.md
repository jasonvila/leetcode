b'<div class="question-description">\n<p><p>Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.</p>\n<p>Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.</p>\n<p>So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br/>\n<ol>\n<li>Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.</li>\n<li>Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.</li>\n<li>As long as a house is in the heaters\' warm radius range, it can be warmed.</li>\n<li>All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3],[2]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 1\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.\r\n</pre>\n</br></p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br/>\n<pre>\r\n<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3,4],[1,4]\r\n<b>Output:</b> 1\r\n<b>Explanation:</b> The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4.
